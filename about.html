    <img src="IMG_2079.JPG" alt="Proffessional Headshot" class="center">
    <p>My name is Kaitlyn, and I am currently studying Coding and Web Development.
        After starting my proffessional career as a ballerina, I decided it was time to retire and 
        transition into a different sort of career.
        The patterning and design in Coding is very fascinating to me, and I am excited to see what
        can be created. The possibilities really do seem endless. <br> <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy reading, gardening, baking, hiking, and spending time with my wife and our pets.
